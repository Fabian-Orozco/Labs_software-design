# Composition Pattern Lab

## Objectives

1. Apply the "Composition" pattern to a specific design problem.
2. Programmatically implement a specific design with these patterns.

## Problem Statement

Develop a maze game similar to the Wumpus game, where the player (Hunter) must catch monsters (Wumpus, Cadejos) without dying.

## Required Functionality

- Include at least two classes of monsters.
- Existence of "monster packs" with class restriction.
- Responsibilities of the game controller.
- Freedom for monsters and packs to join or separate.
- Movement, intelligent action, and attacking the Hunter.

## Solution Characteristics

- Design respecting SOLID principles.
- Implementation of the Composition pattern.
- Functional C++ code as a proof of concept.
- Class model in PDF format.
